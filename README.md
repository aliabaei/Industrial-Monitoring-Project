This project is about monitoring raw bodies that need to be painted in paint cabins.
The project identifies the bodies entering the paint cabin and, by connecting to Siemens PLC, provides the necessary information for body recognition to the robots.
The robots, based on the received information, select the required trajectory for each body, and the body will be painted by the robots accordingly.

Project Requirements:
Basler industrial cameras
An interface program that creates a virtual port

Installation and Setup:
1. Install the camera software.
2. Launch the virtual port creator program and create two virtual ports for communication.
3. Run the monitoring program.
